      PatternFly is an open-source design system for building consistent, accessible user interfaces.
      It provides React components, design guidelines, and development tools for creating enterprise applications.
      PatternFly is used by Red Hat and other organizations to build consistent UIs with reusable components.
      The PatternFly MCP server provides tools to access PatternFly documentation, component schemas, and design guidelines.
